# Contribute

Please contribute with original content, if you think another site has already explained a section/technology better than you provide a link and add __attributions and references__ if necessary to external sites, it's nice when your work is recognized by others. We know its hard to write something new that explains something old, that is simpler and more clear so in some cases its better to make diagrams to explain yourself and try to explain the same concepts in a more interesting and fun way.

If you work with us pelase include yourself on the [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS) file, so we can track your contributions properlly. Each user should make his contributions with his own account, for the same reason as above otherwise we won't be able to tell __who__ contributed with __what__.
