##How to install and update Xcode.

To install the IDE to develop iOS applications, you have to download it ALWAYS from the official link:
[https://developer.apple.com/download/](https://developer.apple.com/download/)

You can also download it from the [Mac Store](https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)


If you need to try the beta version of iOS you will also need the beta version of Xcode.
All beta software you can find it in: [https://developer.apple.com/support/beta-software/](https://developer.apple.com/support/beta-software/)

To maintain several versions you have to do it naming them different.

A good practice while developing is to use tools that help you with the readability of your code. Using rules and .. you can ensure that your project is nice and consistent. This will be discussed more fully in section [Diagnostics & Profiling](diagnostics/Diagnostics.md)

##Human Interfaces Guidelines and design topics.

As Apple said: *"The worldâ€™s most advanced mobile OS offers everything you need to design beautiful, engaging apps that radiate power and simplicity."*

To do it you can follow the official Human Interface Guidelines (HIG): [https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/)
